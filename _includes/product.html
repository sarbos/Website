                <p>We are creating a rifle controller for virtual reality shooter games. Our main innovation is the software and hardware technology used to precisely track the motion of the controller.  We have taken that technology and integrated it with a rifle body. The controller has many physically realistic features such as reloading, slide action, recoil, and accurate aiming. We are developing a software development kit (SDK) to allow easy integration with multiple games and game engines, so that we can get it up and running with your favorite games quickly. The experience that our controller provides is incredibly realistic and immersive, taking  your gaming experience to the next level.</p>
            
                <h4>Our vision for the future</h4>
                <p>The Rifle is just our first step. We plan on developing a whole line of controllers, including pistols, shotguns, snipers, swords, daggers and really anything you could imagine using in a game. This technology has applications in many different industries besides consumer games. In the future we could potentially develop games to help surgeons practice to increase the rate of successful surgeries, have a safer virtual environment for firefighters to train in, or create simulations to help police recruits learn how to accurately assess and handle situations in the line of duty. </p>
