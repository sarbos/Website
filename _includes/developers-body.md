# Ilium Developer Program

Ilium VR is launching a devloper program for game developers interested in creating games and applications for our controllers. We want to see what experiences you can create with our system, while helping us find potential bugs.

The development kit will include a gun controller, an optical tracker, and a mount for use with an Oculus Rift. You will get full hardware and software support as well as access to our bug reporting and feature request system.

# FAQ

###### I am not making a VR game/I dont have a VR headset. Can I still join the program?
Yes! Our system is designed to be used both with and without VR. We prefer applications using VR, but if you have a good idea we want to hear it.

###### What game engines are supported?
The Ilium VR SDK fully supports Unreal Engine 4 and Unity 5. We will be working on a Source engine integration as well.

###### What platforms are supported?
The Ilium Runtime is currently only on Windows 7 and up. Linux support is on our roadmap for the future.
